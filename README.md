# Forward Learning of Graph Neural Networks
This repository provides the datasplits 
used in the paper ["Forward Learning of Graph Neural Networks"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.11004.pdf), 
Namyong Park, Xing Wang, Antoine Simoulin, Shuai Yang, Grey Yang, Ryan Rossi, Puja Trivedi, Nesreen Ahmed, 
The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2024.

## Data Splits
The [`datasplits`](./datasplits/) folder contains the node splits and edge splits of the five graph datasets used for the node classification and link prediction experiments in the paper, respectively.

## Code of ForwardGNN
The code of the ForwardGNN framework is available at [this repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/forwardgnn).
